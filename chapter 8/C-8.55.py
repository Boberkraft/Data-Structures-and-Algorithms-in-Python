Exercise P-4.27 described the walk function of the os module. This function
performs a traversal of the implicit tree represented by the file system.
Read the formal documentation for the function, and in particular its use
of an optional Boolean parameter named topdown. Describe how its behavior
relates to tree traversal algorithms described in this chapter.

Topdown = True => preorder
Topdown = False => PostOrder
