"""
Describe, in pseudo-code, an algorithm for computing the number of descendants
of each node of a binary tree. The algorithm should be based
on the Euler tour traversal.

class Euler(BinaryEulerTour):
    def postvisit(p,d,path,results):
        if tree.is_leaf(p):
            return 1
        else
            return sum(results)

Hints to Exercises hints that this should use post,pre and invisit.
But why?
