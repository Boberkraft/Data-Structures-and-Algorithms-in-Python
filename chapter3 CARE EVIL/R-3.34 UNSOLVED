 There is a well-known city (which will go nameless here) whose inhabitants
have the reputation of enjoying a meal only if that meal is the best
they have ever experienced in their life. Otherwise, they hate it. Assuming
meal quality is distributed uniformly across a personâ€™s life, describe
the expected number of times inhabitants of this city are happy with their
meals?
