 Describe an efficient algorithm for finding the ten largest elements in a
sequence of size n. What is the running time of your algorithm?

yo can always sort and then pick 10 first numbers O(n log n)

or implement find_and_destroy()
find_and_destroy(S) # assume non empy list
    biggest = 0
    for i in range(len(s):
        if S[biggest] < S[i]:
            biggest = 0
    b = S[biggest]
    S[biggest]= 0
    return b
it have complexity O(n) and worst O(2n) with is still O(n)
now aplly this algorith 10 times for sequence n and you are home in
Complexity O(10n) => O(n)
