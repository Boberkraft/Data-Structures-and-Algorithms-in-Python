Al says he can prove that all sheep in a flock are the same color:
Base case: One sheep. It is clearly the same color as itself.
Induction step: A flock of n sheep. Take a sheep, a, out. The remaining
n − 1 are all the same color by induction. Now put sheep a back in and
take out a different sheep, b. By induction, the n− 1 sheep (now with a)
are all the same color. Therefore, all the sheep

????
Showing that sheep a color doasnt mean every sheep have that color too.
They have nothing in common. They are independed ;p
Consider:
Red Pink
if a = red, b = pink, it already fails
even for bigger number of sheep

its only true for n = 1
