Let S be a set of n lines in the plane such that no two are parallel and
no three meet in the same point. Show, by induction, that the lines in S
determine Θ(n2) intersection points.


I dony see it Θ(n2). I rather see it something near O(2n) :/
1 line -> 0 points
2 lines -> 1 point
3 lines -> 3 int points
4 lines -> +3 points
5 lines -> +4 points
6 lines -> +5 points
7 lines -> +6 points
so it is just summarization :/
