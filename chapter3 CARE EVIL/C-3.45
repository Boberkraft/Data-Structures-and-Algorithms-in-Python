A sequence S contains n − 1 unique integers in the range [0,n − 1], that
is, there is one number from this range that is not in S. Design an O(n)-
time algorithm for finding that number. You are only allowed to use O(1)
additional space besides the sequence S itself.

After some time i cheated and looked up and after sawing first word "sum" i got it :^)
Just sum integers form 0 to n and then substract from sum of your number
