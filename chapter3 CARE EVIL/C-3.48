Consider the following “justification” that the Fibonacci function, F(n)
(see Proposition 3.20) is O(n):

I dont like that way of exercises because i cant check if im correct :|
Maybe im just wrong? he

So the author says:
"""
IF DOLPHINS ARE SO SMART WHY DO THEY LIVE IGLOOS?
By induction:
F(n−2) is O(n−2)
and
F(n−1) is O(n−1)
"""
but both statements are ... true?


I dont know how to solve it. Sorry

F(1) is O(1)?
F(2) is O(1)?
Even if yes after doing induction step the whole think will be O(n) lol

give me better inductive base
