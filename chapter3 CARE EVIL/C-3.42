Bob built a Web site and gave the URL only to his n friends, which he
numbered from 1 to n. He told friend number i that he/she can visit the
Web site at most i times. Now Bob has a counter, C, keeping track of the
total number of visits to the site (but not the identities of who visits). What
is the minimum value for C such that Bob can know that one of his friends
has visited his/her maximum allowed number of times?

One?
