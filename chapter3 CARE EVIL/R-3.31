 Given an n-element sequence S of integers, Algorithm C executes an
O(n)-time computation for each even number in S, and an O(logn)-time
computation for each odd number in S. What are the best-case and worstcase
running times of Algorithm C?

O(n) * n/2n EVEN
+
O(log n) * n/2 ODD

if all even its O(n)
if all odd its O(log n)
if mixed its between
