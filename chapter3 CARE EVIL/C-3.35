 Assuming it is possible to sort n numbers in O(nlogn) time, show that it
is possible to solve the three-way set disjointness problem in O(nlogn)
time.

firstly you need to sort a list O(n log n)
and then for each element of the list O(n) (or every two..)
check disjointness the nearby elements so 2 basic operations O(1)
n log n + n < 2 n log n
so O(n log n)
