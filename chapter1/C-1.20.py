# Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function shuffle(data) that accepts a
# list of elements and randomly reorders the elements so that each possible
# order occurs with equal probability. The random module includes a
# more basic function randint(a, b) that returns a uniformly random integer
# from a to b (including both endpoints). Using only the randint function,
# implement your own version of the shuffle function
