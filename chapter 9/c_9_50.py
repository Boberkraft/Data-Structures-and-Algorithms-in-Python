"""
An online computer system for trading stocks needs to process orders of
the form “buy 100 shares at $x each” or “sell 100 shares at $y each.” A
buy order for $x can only be processed if there is an existing sell order
with price $y such that y ≤ x. Likewise, a sell order for $y can only be
processed if there is an existing buy order with price $x such that y ≤ x.
If a buy or sell order is entered but cannot be processed, it must wait for a
future order that allows it to be processed. Describe a scheme that allows
buy and sell orders to be entered in O(logn) time, independent of whether
or not they can be immediately processed.

Store sell orders in min heap

and store buy orders in max heap

when new elements becomes the root, we need to check if a transaction can succeed
