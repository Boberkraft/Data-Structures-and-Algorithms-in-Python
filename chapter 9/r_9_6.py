"""
Can you adapt your solution to the previous problem to make remove min
run in O(1) time for the UnsortedPriorityQueue class? Explain your answer.

Hmm yes?
but then i have to maintain an linked list that containing sorted items to be retrived from.
But this will add overhead to the add method.
So no.

I cannot retrive in constant time all values in order - its will be revolutional
to sorting algorithms!
