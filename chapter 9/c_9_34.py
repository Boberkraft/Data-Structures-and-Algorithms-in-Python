"""
We can represent a path from the root to a given node of a binary tree
by means of a binary string, where 0 means “go to the left child” and 1
means “go to the right child.” For example, the path from the root to the
node storing (8,W) in the heap of Figure 9.12a is represented by “101.”
Design an O(logn)-time algorithm for finding the last node of a complete
binary tree with n nodes, based on the above representation. Show how
this algorithm can be used in the implementation of a complete binary tree
by means of a linked structure that does not keep a reference to the last
node.

i just did the same in c_9_32

You can calculate dynamicly the last node using this function
just call it with length parameter.
