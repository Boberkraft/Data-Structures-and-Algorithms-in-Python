"""
There is a simple, but inefficient, algorithm, called bubble-sort, for sorting
a list L of n comparable elements. This algorithm scans the list nâˆ’1 times,
where, in each scan, the algorithm compares the current element with the
next one and swaps them if they are out of order. Implement a bubble sort
function that takes a positional list L as a parameter. What is the running
time of this algorithm, assuming the positional list is implemented with a
doubly linked list?

Its O(N)
