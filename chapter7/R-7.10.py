There seems to be some redundancy in the repertoire of the positional
list ADT, as the operation L.add first(e) could be enacted by the alternative
L.add before(L.first( ), e). Likewise, L.add last(e) might be performed
as L.add after(L.last( ), e).

What if we dont know the any node????
What if List is empty?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
