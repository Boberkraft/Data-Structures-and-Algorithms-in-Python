In Section 4.2 we prove by induction that the number of lines printed by a call to $interval(c)$ is $2^{c} - 1$. Another interesting question is how many dashes are printed during that process. Prove by induction that the number of dashes printed by $interval(c)$ is $2^{c+1} -c-2$.\\\\

Base case:\\
$interval(n) = 2^{n+1}-n-2 $\\
$interval(1) = 2^{2}-1-2 = 1$\\
$interval(2) = 2^{3}-2-2 = 4$\\\\

Hyppotesis:


$interval(n+1) = 2\cdot interval(n)+n+1$\\\\
$= 2\cdot(2^{n+1}-n-2) + n + 1$\\
$= 2\cdot 2^{n+1}- 2n-4 +n+1$\\
$= 2^{(n+1)+1}-n-4 +1$\\
$= 2^{(n+1)+1}-(n+1)-4 $\\
why it is 4 not 2 :c help pls
