"""
Suppose you have three nonempty stacks R, S, and T. Describe a sequence
of operations that results in S storing all elements originally in T below all
of Sâ€™s original elements, with both sets of those elements in their original
order. The final configuration for R should be the same as its original
configuration. For example, if R = [1,2,3], S = [4,5], and T = [6,7,8,9],
the final configuration should have R = [1,2,3] and S = [6,7,8,9,4,5].

You can still use R as temporary storage, as long as you never
pop its original contents.
