"""
The shuffle method, supported by the random module, takes a Python
list and rearranges it so that every possible ordering is equally likely.
Implement your own version of such a function. You may rely on the
randrange(n) function of the random module, which returns a random
number between 0 and nâˆ’1 inclusive.
