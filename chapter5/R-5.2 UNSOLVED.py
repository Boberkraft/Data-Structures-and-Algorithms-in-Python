"""
In Code Fragment 5.1, we perform an experiment to compare the length of
a Python list to its underlying memory usage. Determining the sequence
of array sizes requires a manual inspection of the output of that program.
Redesign the experiment so that the program outputs only those values of
k at which the existing capacity is exhausted. For example, on a system
consistent with the results of Code Fragment 5.2, your program should
output that the sequence of array capacities are 0, 4, 8, 16, 25, ....

I cant figure it out without looking at python list implementation.
Leaving it for now.
