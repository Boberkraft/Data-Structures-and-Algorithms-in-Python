"""In the experiment of Code Fragment 5.1, we begin with an empty list. If
data were initially constructed with nonempty length, does this affect the
sequence of values at which the underlying array is expanded? Perform
your own experiments, and comment on any relationship you see between
the initial length and the expansion sequence.

Sorry i cant find code fragment 5.1
