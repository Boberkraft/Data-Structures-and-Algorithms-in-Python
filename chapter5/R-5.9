9 Explain the changes that would have to be made to the program of Code
Fragment 5.11 so that it could perform the Caesar cipher for messages
that are written in an alphabet-based language other than English, such as
Greek, Russian, or Hebrew.

You need to gather all possible letters, order them and then put them in array.
next create new encoded list that is shifted.

Dont forget to change line:
j = ord(msg[k]) - ord('A')
to
j = original.find(msg[k])
