"""Redo the justification of Proposition 5.1 assuming that the the cost of
growing the array from size k to size 2k is 3k cyber-dollars. How much
should each append operation be charged to make the amortization work?

Assuming that append still takes 1 cyber-dollar => n appends costs n cyber-dollars.
and to resize we need 3k cyber-dollars. So charging 4 cyber-dolars will do.
